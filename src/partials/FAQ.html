                Firstly, make sure your headphones are turned on with a single
                press of the top button on the back of the right earbud. Then
                press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to put the
                headphones into pairing mode. Please note that if you connect
                the headphones for the first time, they will automatically turn
                on immediately in this pairing mode. Voice prompts will provide
                you with additional instructions. We recommend that you use the
                Bose Music app to complete the pairing process, however you can
                also use the Bluetooth settings on your device.
